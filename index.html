        <h1>How can you describe me?</h1>
        <p>To start out my introduction, I am a freshman on my way to become a sophmore. For most people, I am a rather difficult person to approach, especially since their first impression of me is a productive human being (at least that's how I would see myself as if I were a stranger). Nonetheless, I am actually a lazy person that is only productive when other people are around because I don't have any self discipline.</p>
        <h2>What activities do I enjoy?</h2>
        <p>Compared to most people my age, I have a quite a range of activities because I don't seem to have one specific thing that I like. As long as I have worked hard on something for a long time, I tend to feel a connection between that activity. From my experiences, I have learned not to judge anyone or anything just because of my first impression or interaction. But regardless, I still like some activities more than others. Here's a list of some of the activities that I love:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Piano</li>
            <li>Tennis</li>
            <li>Boy Scouts</li>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Blogging</li>
            <li>Art</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What do I intend to become?</h2>
        <p>After I graduate from highschool, I plan on majoring in either architectural engineering or architecture, while minoring in botany. From these majors, I be able to create structures that will help save the world from the destructive path of global warming, which after all, will destroy the place we originate.</p>
